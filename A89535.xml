            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <head>OF THE HORSE.</head>
            <p>HORSES are of the greatest Understanding, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in them (as the School-men affirm) a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain natural Instinct, not only of the knowledge of their Riders and Keepers, but also of their own Generation and Descent, knowing their Sires and Dames, in such wise that they will refuse (as <hi>Pliny</hi> saith) to couple or ingender with them: they are also of all Creatures the aptest to learn any Motion, and the readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est to obey their Teachers, having a greater Love to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise than any other Beast. They are of great Courage and Valour, delight in Wars; and (as some School-men affirm) have a certain fore-knowledge of Battel, and will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare themselves for the same. A Horse lives to 50 Years, tho' commonly but to 30.</p>
            <p>The Mares are less lived, as till twenty, or five and twenty at the most; they are fit for the Saddle at four Years of age, for the Wars at six, for the Race at eight, and for Hunting, or for extream Matches at ten or eleven: The Females bear their Foals full eleven Months and Foal in the twelfth, or twelve Months and ten Days: The best time for their ingendring is <hi>March,</hi> at the increase of the Moon, or in the Middle part thereof, and the Mare foaleth her Foal standing: they are supposed to be so loving and kind
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:154059:6"/> to their Generation, that if a Foal lose the Dam, yet the other Mares which are Milch, will of their own accord, lend their Teats, and feed or nurse up the Orphan Foal. Horses are subject to more Diseases than any other Beast, for they have full as many as belong to a Man; and yet notwithstanding, all those Diseases may be cured by twelve Medicines only, not twelve Pence charge, as you shall find by reading what followeth.</p>
            <div type="rules">
               <head>Rules to manage your Horses so that no Distempers shall seize them.</head>
               <list>
                  <item>1. IN the Morning drive them moderately.</item>
                  <item>2. When they have done Labour rub them well down.</item>
                  <item>3. Then tye them to the Rack from Meat an Hour or more, and between whiles keep them rubing till their tired Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits be refresh'd.</item>
                  <item>4. Then give them a moderate quantity of Meat and Drink.</item>
                  <item>5. Let the Stables be open to the Air and very clean swept, and keep the Horses clean.</item>
                  <item>6. Let not your Horses, especially your Sadled ones, have constantly Hay in the Rack, nor Provender in the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but tye them from the Rack 5 or 6 Hours toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</item>
                  <item>7. Let them have but such a quantity of Meat as they may eat up clean.</item>
                  <item>8. When your Horse has been hard rid or work'd much you may conveniently give him a little Water about one Hour before you give him Meat, and let him be well rub'd down and stand an Hour or Two before you Water him. Rubing down Horses is better then walking them when hot.</item>
                  <item>9. If you give your Horses Grains as many do about <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> put a little Salt into them, which prevents rot, and watry, and windy Distempers.</item>
                  <item>10. Let your Mares with Fole, and their Colts run in the Fields for a Year.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Observe but these Rules, and your Horses will seldom want Drenching or Bleeding, but if you find they prove two fast, the best way to cool their Blood and keep them from Diseases, is to give them moderate Labour, and alter the quality of their Food.</p>
               <p>The best Food for Horses is good Rick Hay about three quarters of a Year old, which is much better then Hay out of the Barn, and Corn in the Straw is much better and cleansing then that that is thrash'd, or thrash'd and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:154059:6"/> from Chafe; and Beans, Fitches, Barly, Oates and Pease in the Straw is the most hearty Food and cleanseth the Stomach from all superfluities. But Thresht Corn of any sort is good Food for working Horses that go to Grass, especially in Winter, giving it them Morning and Night. Put your Stable Horses to Grass from <hi>May</hi> to <hi>July,</hi> which will cleanse their Bodies and cure their Feet and Legs of Diseases contracted by standing in the Stable all Winter, Rain, River, and Spring-water is best for Horses and other Cattle, much better then Pond-water. To allay burning with Shot, Gun-powder or Wild-fire: Take fresh Butter, and the whites of Eggs, of each as much as is sufficient; beat them well together to an Unguent or Salve, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint the Place burnt and it cures speedily. <hi>probatum est.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>To feed Horses well without Hay.</head>
               <p>CHop half a Peck of Straw small and mingle a handful of Oats amongst it, and put in the Manger several times a Day, and let them drink often, or you may put in the Paste of Turnips instead of Oats, which will do full as well, make the Paste with the coursest Corn ground; or cut, shred, and chop Fur Tops, and give them your Horses, and they will exceedingly thrive therewith; this I had from a great Lord. A great Traveller us'd to give his Horse a Half penny worth of Carrets, either boil'd or raw, which will answer half a Peck of Oats.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Hartfordshire,</hi> they cut Beans and Oats small, and give their Horses with Chaff or cut Straw, and they thereby eat up all and thrive exceedingly. Parsnips are excellent likewise for all sort of Cattle, and will seed them fat in a small time; they will feed Calves and Lambs very fat, and being boiled will feed Swine to the height of fatness in a Fortnights space, and the Liqour will feed them better than the best Whey. Cows are very greedy for the Liquor of Turnip boiled, and I have seen them feed them without any other Food, and become fat there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: Turnips boiled will feed all sorts of Poultry fat, and make them lay Eggs constantly without any Corn at all; whereby may be kept Pheasants, Turkeys, Geese, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridg, Coots, Moor-Cocks in abundance without any charge; I have known Horses kept fat by sliceing them, and casting them into the Manger; and of all Food what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, nothing is more wholsom nd healthful for Cattle. You may keep all sorts of Poultry (and Rabbets) by a Paste made of Beasts Liver, the coursest ground Corn and Bran with a Competent even Mixture, but I have left out the Livers, and made a Paste with the Rest compounded with
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:154059:7"/> Turnips. But in Conclusion, Turnips of themselves are the only food for Poultry and Swine, <hi>probat. est:</hi> Turnips boil'd and mingled with Bran will feed hunting Dogs very highly without other relief.</p>

                  <p>IF the Horse have been brought weak by sickness, and that you find it proceedeth from some inward Infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Corruption of Blood, give him in the Morning fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting two Spoonfuls of the Powder of <hi>Diapente,</hi> well brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with four Spoonfuls of Honey, and toss'd to and fro in a pint of sweet Wine, as Muskadine or Malmsey; and then ride or walk him up and down in the Sun an Hour after: then set him up very warm in the Stable, and let him fall an Hour, and then give him such Provender as he will eat, and his Hay sprinkled with a little Water: But if his sickness proceed from any cold cause, or from over-riding, and too sudden cooling, or from washing when he was hot, or such like, then you shall give the same quantity of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apente</hi> and Honey in <hi>Sack,</hi> or other hot Wine, in the same manner, as aforesaid: But if his sickness be less contagious, or that Wine is not ready to be had, then you shall give the same quantity of the aforesaid Powder and Honey, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a Quart of strong <hi>Ale,</hi> or a Quart of strong <hi>Beer,</hi> observing all the Instructions formerly declared. Now for this Powder which is called <hi>Diapente,</hi> or (of some) <hi>Horse-Mithridate,</hi> because it is a general <hi>Antidote</hi> or preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative against all poysonous Infection, make it in this manner, Take of <hi>Aristolochia rotunda,</hi> of <hi>Gentiana,</hi> of <hi>Myrrh,</hi> of <hi>Bacchi laures,</hi> and of <hi>Ehori,</hi> of each a like
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:154059:8"/> quantity, beat them all together in a Mortar to a very fine Powder, and then searse it till not any grosness be left, and then keep it either in a close Pot, or in a Bladder, and use it as beforesaid, when you have occasion, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to do it divers Mornings together, if the Sickness be violent. Now for as much as this Powder may many times be wanting, or at least hard to come by on the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, therefore in case of such extremity, take a good Handful of <hi>Celandine</hi> Roots and Leaves and all, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving pick'd and cleansed them, take of <hi>Wormwood,</hi> of <hi>Rue,</hi> of each half a Handful, boyl these in a Pottle of strong <hi>Ale</hi> or <hi>Beer</hi> till a full half be consumed, then strain it, and press the Herbs exceedingly, and then dissolve into the Drink almost half a Pound of sweet Butter, and an ounce and a half of the best <hi>Treacle,</hi> and being no more but lukewarm, give it the Horse to drink in the Morning fasting, and ride or walk him an Hour after it, then set him up warm, and let him fast another Hour, then give him, Meat as aforesaid: and do this divers Mornings ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the greatness of his Sickness. Now in this cure you must by no means forget to let the Horse blood in the Neck-vein, an Hour or two before you give him the first Drink, and let him bleed till you see the corrupt Blood change and begin to look pure: to know which, save the first Blood, and the last Blood, in two Saucers, and as they cool, they will easily shew you the difference. Now if your Horse happen to fall suddenly Sick under you, as you travel, when there is no Town nor help near you, then presently light from his Back, and with a sharp-pointed Knife, or Bodkin, or for want of both, with a strong pointed Tag, prick him in the Roof of the Mouth amongst the Bars, somewhat near to his uppermost Teeth, and make him bleed well; walking him forward, and suffering him to champ and eat his own Blood, which is very whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som, and almost a present cure: now if the Blood stanch of it self, (as commonly it will) then presently Piss in his Mouth; and so ride him with all gentleness and ease home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and being set up warm, wash his Mouth and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strils with Vinegar, and the next Morning let him Blood in the Neck-vein, and give him either of the Drenches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prescribed, and no doubt but you may hold on your journey without danger. Now if in the Pricking of the Horse in the Mouth, you either strike your Knife too deep, or else cut the Vein in sunder, whereby you cannot stanch the Blood, (as it many times hapneth) in this case, put some big round piece of Wood into the Horses Mouth (to keep him from biting) and then take a little of the fine Down of a <hi>Hares-skin,</hi> or a <hi>Conies-skin,</hi> or (for want of them) the fine Lint of any Wollen Cloth, and hold it

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:154059:12"/> great use for hunting Horses, and running Horses to be given after their Heats, because it doth cleanse the Body, prevent all inward Sicknesses, keep a Horse cool and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble in his Body, and adds more Courage and Mettle than any other food whatsoever: Lastly, the use of this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine one Fortnight, is as good as a Quarter of a Years feeding at Grass at any time of the Year, and worketh as many and more good Effects, especially in this, that this Medicine is to be had at all times, and Grass is to be had but only in Summer-season: but whereas at Grass (if it be rank and sweet) a Horse is in danger of many Sicknesses, as the Yellows, Staggers, Anticor, and many others, which proceed from the Corruption of the Blood, or the Heat of the Season; by the use of this Medicine all these Infirmities are taken away, and the Horse reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth Flesh, Strength, and livelihood of Spirit, without any danger, as proof shall testifie much better than my Writing.</p>

                  <p>THE Ox, Bull, Cow, or Calf, are Beasts naturally of a slow and heavy Disposition, yet fit for the Draught, being temperately handled, and especially the Oxen, or Bulls: the Cows may be, and are sometimes employed in the same Work, but they are more fit for the Pail, or for yeilding Milk, The fat of these beasts is soft, and apt upon any violent exercise to melt, Whence it proceeds that in their labour they may not be driven above an ordinary foot-pace: of this kind of Cattle with us in this Island of great Britain, are four sorts: the first and best, are those which are bread in the West parts, as in <hi>Somersetshire, Gloucestershire, Dorsetshire,</hi> and the Counties adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: these are for the most part of a bloodred Colour, with great, large, and long Bodies, tall of Stature, and slenderly cast downwards: their Horns are little and crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and the Milk which the Cows give, is the very best and wholsomest of all other, The second sort are bred in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>SHeep are naturally of a hot Disposition, weak and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, they will live with less food than any other Beast of their bigness: every thing about them is of good use, the worst of which are their Hoves, and yet the very tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of them upon the Cround are a good Manuring and Enriching of the same: The Rams and Ews are sit for Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration from two Years of Age till ten; and after that, they are only for the Shambles: the Ews carry their Lambs in their Bodies a hundred and fifty Days, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to common Computation. Sheep in our Island of great <hi>Britain</hi> (which is not inferiour to any Kingdom in the World for the excellency of good Sheep) are of sundry Natures, according to the Alteration of the Climates: for where the Ground is most Fertile, there the Sheep are large of Body, and deep woolled, yet is the Staple but of an indifferent fineness,, rather inclining to some course<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, than yielding the best Thread: others are bred of a more barren and wild Earth; yet if the lear be cold,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:154059:14"/> then is the Staple most course, and the Wool both short and hairy, and the least that are bred on the most barren Earth: though the Sheep be the least of Body, and the least of Burthen, yet if the Lear be warm and well co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured, the Wool is of all the Finest, and the Staple of a Fine and Silk-like handling. To conclude, it is better and more natural for a Sheep to be bred abroad in the Fields amongst the Flock, than Domestick at home in the House; for so shall both his Flesh and Fleece be better both for the Taste and other Service.</p>

                  <p>YOur Sheep is disorder'd and their Health wounded, if they are <hi>driven</hi> too hard, or <hi>coursed</hi> with a Dog, or the like; and if they be suffer'd to lye down whilst hot, and this often, they will break out with the Scab or Mange: When about <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> you put them into fresh Pasture if they are close folded it will do the same: If in hot Weather they be often removed from Place to Place it will hinder their thriving and make them Scabby, much wet likewise makes them rot. In the Morning betimes drive your Sheep into fallow Fields, or Downs where Grass is scarce, and take notice of the Situation of the Field; then walk your Sheep gently on the dryest and highest Parts: If there be Corn Fields let them feed about 2 or 3 Hours by the Hedges, about 11 a Clock turn them from the Edge of the Corn Feild or Pasturage into the lowest Clay ground or Valleys you have, and let them lye at ease, and as scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering as you can, use them at all times tenderly, and less food will serve, observe the Method from <hi>May</hi> till <hi>August</hi> if the Weather continue warm, and it will prevent Scab and Mange, when they come into fresh posture, in <hi>May</hi> or <hi>June.</hi> I think is the best time for shearing, if the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer prove wet about <hi>June</hi> or <hi>July,</hi> let your Sheep conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in the Fold till 8 in the Morning, if the Morning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moist, and again let them be folded before the Dew fall, observe these Rules, and you will prevent many Diseases, as Choler, Flegm, Stoppages, Red-water, Coughs, Pains in the Joints, Lameness, and the like; you ought to be more careful of Sheep from <hi>Midsummer</hi> till <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> therefore keep your Sheep till 9 a Clock, or till the Sun hath dryed the moist Vapours and Humidity from the Earth, and then let them out, and keep them on the high and dry Grounds, if the Day prove dry, feed them 3 Hours in lower Grounds, and about Evening, put them in, higher Places, and besure, fold them before the Dew falls
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:154059:15"/> and fold them on dry Ground; from <hi>July</hi> to <hi>September,</hi> Sheep are most subject to Rot, and is occasioned chiefly by two much moisture at the Season, and not from licking up Snails, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as I omit for Brevity.</p>

                  <p>For the Rot in Sheep, put them into a large Barn set about with wooden Troughs, and therein feed them with Oates a Day or two, then put in some Bay Salt stamp'd small and after that a greater quantity till such time as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to distaste it, then give them clean Oats a Day or two more, and after serve them with Salt as before, and thus do till they are well.</p>

                  <head>How to cure all the diseases in Dogs, with three Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines only.</head>
                  <p>OF Dogs there are divers kinds, first the <hi>Grayhound</hi> which exceedeth in swiftness, and is preserved for the Chase, as either to course the wild <hi>Dcer,</hi> the <hi>Hare,</hi> the <hi>Bore,</hi> the <hi>Woolf,</hi> or other Vermine: he is a beast of infinite valour and spirit yet tender, and apt by his fierceness to much casualty; and his only vertue consisteth in the swiftness of his foot. Then there is the <hi>Hound,</hi> which is of a more dull temper, whose only glory is in his smell, hunting and finding out by his scent the tracts and Foot-steps of all sorts of wild beasts: In which he sheweth so much cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that not any winding, turning, or artful double can prevent his search: he is both valiant and industrious,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:154059:18"/> and so unparallel'd with labour, that only by the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his toyl he maketh himself master of what prey soever he hunteth. Next is the Spanniel, which also is singular for his smell upon birds: as the Hound upon beasts; whence it comes that neither Partridge, Pheasant, Rail, Quail, Peacock, nor any other Bird can escape their search: they are of all other Dogs the most loving, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and most familiar with the Man. Then there is the Water-Spanniel whose scent is also his only glory; yet that scent is taken aloft from the Air, and upon the Water; whereby it comes to pass, that no Water-fowl is safe from his search: he is also of a most exceeding strong constitution, being very able to endure the cold, that no sharpness of Winter nor Frost troubleth him, but the Water is as familiar with him as the Air. Then there is the Mastiff, whose vertue is only in his courage, strength, sharpness of Teeth, and aptness to encounter with any fierce wild beast, as Lyons, Bears, Wolves, Tygers, and such like, against which they are so apt, willing and so cunning in their fight, that they seldom or never part but victors. To conclude, for your Tumbler or Lurcher, whose delight is only in killing the Coney: for the Licesces, which only envieth the Fox; and for your general Mongrils whose uses are either for chasing away vermine, or defence of the Husbandmans yard, they were and are in their special natures and qualities with the other fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named Dogs. And touching their diseases, they are cured by one and the self-same Medicine.</p>

                  <p>HAres or Conies are small Beasts, of much more Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly disposition than other beasts; whence cometh the hardness of their living; for as it is written, they will feed fat with the white rind of the Frost, or the Snow: certain it is that in the Frost and shrapest time of Winter they feed best, because then the Frost biting the foggy grass, maketh it most sweet, upon which they delight most to feed. Conies are abundant in their increase, bringing forth their broods once every Month, and of those broods not under three or four at the least; neither doth she so soon disburthen one brood; but she presently runneth to the Buck, and ingendereth for another. The males of these kinds are very unnatural; for if they can find where the young ones are kindled, they presently devour them: whence it comes to pass, that the Female at her time compleat with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draweth her self, and hideth her young, daubing and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming up the hole till they be able to run and shift for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: and then she opening the hole by little and little, giveth them liberty to take the Air, and use their own exercise. As for the profit of them, besides their flesh,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:154059:19"/> which is an excellent food, their skins are of great price and are a most excellent Fur, and little inferiour, for warmth, sweetness, and goodness, to any other. Again, the Wool or Hair of them is very good to make Felts of; and indeed, is so soft and fine, that it is but a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to the Beaver; with which Wool if it be mixed, it maketh a most perfect and good Felt. To conclude, they are beasts of much hardness, and therefore of no long life; and they take delight in hard and sandy grounds, which are dry; for they have no greater Enemy than the wet; whence it proceedeth that their greatest infirmitie is rottenness: yet such Conies as do live and delight in the clay earths, are even the greatest, fattest, stoutest and best, either for the dish, or any sport whatsoever.</p>

                  <p>THe Cock, is a Proud, Valiant, and Couragious Bird. Of all beasts whatsoever, none but he rejoyceth after the act of generation. The Hens are no less Valiant than the Cocks, if they be true bred; and will with their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posites sight to the last drop: they are exceeding loving and natural to their young, and will not only fight in their defence, but also strive themselves, to give the Chickens sustenance.</p>
                  <p>Your <hi>Turkey</hi> is not unlike unto these Birds; for the Cock is Proud, Valiant, and apt to fight; only the Hens are much less natural, though some what more doating: for, from her too much love, she will draw her Chickens abroad, and by her wandring will lose them, never
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:154059:19"/> respecting her number; but so long as she hath one to follow her, so long she respecteth not what hapneth to the rest. Of this nature also is the Peacock, who for Beauty, Pride, and understanding, exceedeth all other Birds, yet only are careless of their Young. The Peacock is a Bird of long life, ordinarily living to the years of five and twenty, or upward: he is a dish much used at Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets, for shew, more than for taste; for his flesh is not held exceeding wholesome, it being certain, that if he be never so well and dry roasted over Night, yet he will be blood raw the next Day following. Now contrary to the Peacock, the Pheasant, Partrige, Quail, and Rail are excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Birds for the Table, and more dainty and wholesome than any other: They are also excellent for flights, and make rare sport before the Hawk: they flie not high, but near to the ground; and though not very nimble of wing, yet yet swift after they are on wing. They love not to flie long, by reason of their much earnestness; but must have many rests: but being slain by the Hawk, they are the best, tenderest, and most pleasing Food. They bring forth their broods in great abundance; and having once disclos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, the young ones are able to defend themselves, by flight, even when their shells are on their crowns: so strong and wily they are by nature, as house Doves are of an innocent nature, and very chast, and neither Male or Female change their mate, but keep together, one true to the other, living as coupled by the Band of Marriage, keeping their own Hen continually, never visiting the holes of others, unless they be single by the death of their mates: the Male and Female are both careful of their young ones; nay, you shall have the Cock oft-times chastise the Hen if she keep not the nest well; and yet kind they be to them when they are about to build, lay, and set, as may be seen by their readiness to them in that case: when the Hen cometh off the nest, the Cock goeth on presently. The Cock will go abroad and first feed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self well, and gorge himself, and when he commeth home will disgorge himself again, feeding his Hen or his young ones. Stock-doves live ordinarily (as <hi>Pliny</hi> affirmeth) thirty years. The Turtle Doves of all the rest are the lovingest to their mate: for you shall see them always fly together, unless one of them be kill'd, then the other will not live long after, but pine away.</p>

                  <p>ALL singing Birds generally do once a Year change their Colours in Feathers, and alter their voice in singing,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:154059:21"/> that of a sudden a Man would say they are other Birds; which is a thing which happeneth not unto the greater Fowls, unless it be only the Crane, for they will at some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of the Year grow blacker than at other some, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially in their old Age: so likewise the Black-bird will grow reddish, and in Summer he singeth clear and tunable, and in Winter he stuttereth and stammereth, but in <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> commonly he is clean mute, and dumb altogether: also if the Black-bird be a Year old, and especially the Males bills turn white like Ivory, so likewise the Throstles all Summer are painted about the necks with sundry Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, but in the Winter they are all of one Colour. The Nightingale also singeth almost fifteen days together in the highth of the Spring, and will learn easily to whistle: and so generally all other singing Birds sing more at one time of the Year than at another, except it be such Birds as are altogether Domestical and tame used only to hear Musick, the Voices of men and continual clamours, Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and Torch-light, such I say will not only sing all the Year long, but also all Day and Night without ceasing, as may be daily discerned in many Noblemens and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Houses. These singing Birds seldom sing the first Year: only in the Winter time they will a little record, and then when the Spring approacheth, they will break forth with their Voices, and sound their notes full and perfect. And of all these singing Birds, the Linnet, Robin, Bulsinch, Star, is most docible, and aptest both to be tame, and learn all several Tunes: they take delight in their Cages and servitude, only they are apt to feed suddenly; and with their too much fatness, often corrupt and dye suddenly; therefore it is not good at any time to let them be without Chalk, Sugar, or Chickweed, which is a great preservative and present help against the disease of fatness; and you must shift them in a fresh Cage every Month, and take their dung from them every morning, and then blow their meat; and when you shift their Cages, put the two doors together and blow on them, and they will shift themselves, for to handle them is dangerous; and and when they moult or cast their Feathers, spout a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Wine on them, and it will the sooner make them moult their old coat: and for those Birds that you would teach and bring up to whistle, you must hang their Cages in such a place where they shall not hear the chirping of Sparrows; for naturally they will take the wild note, as I have known by Experience, and have heard some Birds Crow like a Cock, and counterfeit notes of Birds of other kinds contrary to their own kind. The Star of all other Birds is very apt, ready and tractable to be taught to whistle, to speake any thing without cutting or cliping
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:154059:21"/> the Tongue as I have heard many speake as plain as any Parrot; but you must keep them covered all over, saving a place where they may see their meat and Water; and as you would teach a Parrot, so teach them. And for the dieting of Birds, the Star feedeth chiefly on raw Beef, and Bread soaked in Water, both mixt together, and small minced; the Black-bird and Thrush feed on raw Beef be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whole, and stickt on a stick in their Cage; the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinch and Linnet feed on Rapeseeds; but you must take heed of Mustard-seed, for they are like to Rape-seeds, and will make them pine away: the Canary-bird doth feed on Canery-seed and Rape-seed mixt together, the Robin and Nightingale feed on Oatemeal or raw meat: but if you get them now and then some of the worms that do breed among the flour at the Bakers, it will much avail them.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>How to cure all the diseases in Hawks, of what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or quality soever they be, with six Medicines only.</head>
                  <p>THere are sixteen kinds of Hawks, or Birds that live upon prey; and though every one have in them a special note or Character of much Valour, yet some are much more Valiant than other some; as the Eagle, the Vulture, the Gerfaulcon, Faulcon, and such like. The Valiant Hawk ever trusseth her pray in the Air, the least Valiant taketh her pray near unto the ground. The Valiant Hawks always build upon the highest Rocks and on the steep Cliffs, against which the rage of the Sea and Water con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually beateth; and the less Valiant Hawks build in tall Timber Trees, where they have some shelter and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge: as for those which build in some Walls, or upon the ruins of old Houses, as the Kestrils and such like, they are most base and cowardly, and neither fit for use nor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. The Long-wing'd Hawks are fittest for the River, and kill both the Hern, and the other smaller Fowl, as is the Mallard and Teye: and the Short-wing'd Hawks will kill them and the Hare also. The Merline and Hobby take most delight in killing the Larks: the Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows-hawks in killing the Black-bird, and the Musket in killing the Sparrow only. Many other flights there be, as of the Pie and Jay, and such like, but they are to be measured according to the mettle of the Hawk, for they are flights of danger and force, and therefore it behoves the Hawk to have much cunning and much exercise before she be brought to such flights, lest that her mettle and rashness become her own ruine as many Faulconers find by daily experience.</p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:154059:22"/>
                  <p>The well ordering the Hawk is the chiefest matter to bring him to perfection, and therefore observe when you have taken him from the Cage or Mew, to bath him that then you do it in warm Water and ground Pepper, to kill the Knits and Lice for he is subject to them; feed him high that he may gather Strength to overcome any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper incident to him; and after every flight give him casting of Flannel or Plumage, weathering abroad in the Evening, unless in his bathing times not feeding him up on two several Meats at once, and when he makes a flight at the Field cast him off upon the first Spring of the Game, and when he comes to make his flight at the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you must before he comes near the Fowl cast him off, nor must he see it till becomes to his full pitch, crossing the said Fowl, after twice or thrice enduring and when he has killed her give him the Gizzard and Liver.</p>
                  <p>If you would Man your Hawk well, keep him from sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and make him familiar with you by jumping on your Fist, and then to the Lure, and often staring in his face cherishing him with your Voice and Bounty, that he may perfectly obey your Call, on all occasions, suffering him if he be sullen and stubborn at any time to fast, and having lur'd, man'd and ensnar'd him, that is, managed him and cleansed him from his foulness, then bring him to flight, which if it happen to be at a Pheasant or Partridge in a Woody Close Ground, then upon luring him you must cast your lure into some Bush or Tree, so to bring him to a stand, making him seize thereon, and when you first fly him, let it be at young Game, that he may Conquer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out difficulty, but if you fly a long winged Hawk in a Champain, keep him by any means from his stand main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining till the Game be sprung upon the Wings so that it being under him he may stoop with more Advantage, and the easier take it, yet be sure he miss not the Game, which may occasion his being baulked whilst he be more perfect, mount him to the height of his Gate and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieve the Partridge under him by casting in your Spaniels, and in this manner you may fly all sorts of long wing'd Hawks, and seldom miss your Game: And thus much for the Princely Recreation of Hawking.</p>

Being hunted and ready to be taken by the Hounds, they will for their last refuge fly to houses and places of resort, rather yield to Man than to Dogs: and as <hi>Pliny</hi> saith, they can endure to swim thirty Miles End-ways: and when they are to pass any great River to go to Rut in some Isle or Forest, they assemble themselves together in herds; and knowing the strongest and best Swimmer, they make him go foremost, and then he which cometh the second, stayeth up his head upon the back of the first, and all the rest in like manner even to the last: the foremost being weary, the second taketh his place, and he cometh backward, They go to Rut about the midst of <hi>September,</hi> and bear their young ones eight Months: sometimes they bring two Calves at once: their, little ones they practise and exercise to use their Legs from the very beginning, leading them up to high Rocks teaching them to leap, run, and fly away, acquainting them with their Dens and secret places of harbour; the Males are horned, and they above all other living Creatures cast them every Year once, at a certain time of the Spring; and to that purpose a little before their mewing they seek out the most secret corners, and most out of the way to hide themselves: when they are Pollards, they keep close hidden, as if they were disarmed; and all this they do, as if they envied that men should have good of any thing that they had. Their age may be known by their heads, (for every Year they have one more branch than they had the last Year before) untill they come to six, after which time, they come new ever alike, so that their age cannot be discerned any more by their head, but their mark is taken by their Mouth and Teeth: for as they grow in age, they have few or no Teeth at all: yet the branches grow out of the root, whereas all the while they were younger, they used to have them break forth and standing out at the very forehead. At the first when they break out again, they be like to the glandules or kernels of dry skin, that are new put forth; then grow they with tender stalks to retain round and long knots, covered all over with a certain plume down like Velvet: so long as they be destitute of their Horns and perceive their Heads naked, they go forth for relief by Night; and as they grow bigger and bigger, they har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den them in the hot Sun, often making proof of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Trees: and when they perceive they be tough and
